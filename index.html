						Welcome to my site. Many times people seek therapy when they find themselves in a crisis or need help to work through a life transition that feels overwhelming. Other times people want to take charge of a lifelong problem or break a pattern that continues to make them unhappy. Psychotherapy can provide the support, insight and skills to gain relief from chronic anxiety or depression or create lasting changes in one’s life. 
						<br><br>
						I received a master’s degree in marriage and family therapy from Phillips Graduate University. My training was at the Center for Individual and Family Counseling for two years seeing individuals, couples and families and facilitating parenting classes. Through the center I also worked at the Sulpher Springs School District running social skills groups for elementary-aged children.
						I volunteered for Teen Line where I supervised high school students who managed a crisis line. I also taught a 12-week training course for teens to become Teen Talk Advisors. I received additional training at Didi Hirsch and am a member of the Suicide Response Team and am ASIST certified. Additionally, I am a staff clinician and parent group facilitator at Westside DBT. Outside of work I have a mindfulness practice, enjoy spending time with family and friends and love to surf as often as possible.

						<h3>Therapy</h3><br>
						My therapy approach utilizes training in treatment models designed to help people identify and work through core issues and problematic relationship patterns. I work collaboratively with my clients and my approach emphasizes accessing and experiencing authentic feelings, identifying and changing old relationship patterns, and learning to live more consciously.
						<br><br>
						Each individual, couple or family that I work with is unique and I value the process of getting to know my clients as the people they truly are. Some issues I treat are parenting support, interpersonal conflict, grief, trauma, depression, anxiety, attachment issues, addictions (including those in recovery), and difficulties with boundaries and trust.
